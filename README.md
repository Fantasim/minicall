# Minimalistic JS task scheduler ðŸ›µ

<br />

*Extremely **minimalistic** and **simple** task scheduler built in just 2 hours due to frustration with the bugs, dependencies, and heavy bundle weight of the current popular task scheduler libraries in JavaScript.* ðŸ˜¤

This library is very humble and doesn't compete in terms of features, but it is simple:

- Supports both **browser** and **node** environments.
- Only requires **two** simple **parameters**, with no useless ones.
- Has **no dependencies** and is lightweight, with a size of only **1.6kB**. ðŸŽˆ
- No unexpected schedule, no bugs, no nonsense.


<br />

## Installation
```sh
yarn add minicall
```

<br />

## Quick start

```ts
import minicall from 'minicall'

const task = new minicall({
    time: ["12:34:56", "22:22:22"], //Based on UTC time 
    execute: () => console.log('task to execute'),
})

task.start()
```

### With a filter

```ts
import minicall from 'minicall'

const task = new minicall({
    time: ["03:00:00"],
    execute: () => console.log('task to execute'),
    filter: (): boolean => [1, 3, 5].includes(new Date().getDay()) //only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
})

task.start()
```

### Interval

```ts
import minicall from 'minicall'

const task = new minicall({
    time: 30 * 1000, //every 30 seconds
    execute: () => console.log('task to execute'),
    filter: (): boolean => new Date().getUTCHours() == 5 //only between 5:00pm and 6:00pm
})

task.start()
```

<br />

<br />

<br />


That's it.
